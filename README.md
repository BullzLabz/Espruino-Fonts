# Espruino-Fonts

This repo contains all the fonts that i've created to work with [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/).\
All Fonts created here have been tested and works perfectly with the **0.96" (128x64)** displays **SSD1306/SSH1306**.

You can also use these Fonts with Arduino or others SSD1306/SSH1306 Library.
