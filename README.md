# Espruino-Fonts

This repo contains all the fonts that i've created to work with [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/).\
All Fonts created here have been tested and works perfectly with the **0.96" (128x64)** displays **SSD1306/SSH1306**.

You can also use these Fonts with Arduino or others SSD1306/SSH1306 Library.

## CBold-Fonts

The **CBold Fonts** was designed by [@ArtFaks](https://github.com/BullzArtDesign) to offer a good readability by taking the least possible space on a small screen like **OLED SSD1306 or SH1106 (128x64 - 0.96 ")** displays.

You can choose between two versions:
* The **"Fixed"** version has a width of 12px and a height of 32px.
* The **"variable"** version has a variable width and keeps a height of 32px.

You are free to use these fonts in your Arduino, Espruino project.
